# london-crime
The app is built with shiny. So we first begin by loading the csv file, i.e. finaldata.csv and then by running the code we can get insights as to which type of crime is more prone to occur across various boroughs in London. 
In the first tab, you can feel free to play around with the crime type filter and borough to gain some valuable insights.
As for the second tab, you can do some predictions as for a crime type and a borough, what crime rate we could expect in the next year.
